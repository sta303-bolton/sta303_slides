## Thank you for completing the end-of-week check-in!

* Happy belated birthday to the friends and family members you told me you were celebrating with over reading week. Hope you had a great time playing board games, watching K-dramas and anime, playing piano, going for walks by yourself or with your do, sledding and going to hot springs (jealous!). But maybe don't tell me you're doing illegal things in a class survey... 



* What did you think of the data exploration assessment and how long did it take you? Small sample, and almost certainly biased because this survey is opt-in...but this looks pretty reasonable to me.

## Cheat sheet template

I've made a template for a 'cheat sheet' on which you can take these notes/play with code. You can access it with the `sta303_w7` package.

Just open RStudio, either locally or on the JupyterHub (wherever you can Knit) and run the following code in the __console.__


```r
devtools::install_github("sta303-bolton/sta303w7")
# If it prompts you to update packages, 
# just click 'Enter' or 'Return' or input 3
```

Then, go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown and choose 'From template' and select 'Distribution cheat sheet {sta303w7}'. 

Important: If you're working in the JupyterHub, make sure you save the .Rmd in a subfolder of your Home directory so it doesn't cause class interactives to fail in future. (Can't have any .Rmd in your Home directory.)

## Creating tables in R



Suppose our raw data has an observation per row. 


```r
ontario &lt;- readRDS("data/w7/ontario_full.RDS")
head(ontario)
```
```
Rows: 14,864,428
Columns: 2
$ Age    &lt;fct&gt; 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 to 09, 0 …
$ Status &lt;chr&gt; "Hospitalized", "Hospitalized", "Hospitalized", "Hospitalized", "…
```

---
## Creating tables

You can create a table with the `table()` function in R. (The `xtabs` function is also useful for creating cross (x) tables.)







```r
hosp_table &lt;- table(ontario$Age, ontario$Status)
hosp_table
```

```
           Hospitalized Not hospitalized
  0 to 09            98          1518429
  10 to 19           92          1617845
  20 to 29          402          2099773
  30 to 39          668          2055388
  40 to 49         1010          1875575
  50 to 59         1932          2059005
  60 to 69         2714          1792333
  70 to 79         3151          1156747
  80 to 89         3354           536361
  90+              1645           137906
```

## Calculations with tables

.midi[
From this kind of table there are three types of proportions that we can calculate.

* __Joint__
  * Joint proportions reflect the proportion total observation for which given levels of your categorical variables co-occur. I.e., what proportion of people were over 90 and hospitalized?
  * General calculation: Cell value over the grand total.
* __Marginal__
  * Marginal proportions sum across rows or columns. I.e., what is the proportion the Ontario population that has been hospitalized? We'd need to add up all the hospitalized and then divide that by the sum of all the cells.
  * General calculation: Row or columns sums over the grand total
* __Conditional__
  * Conditional proportions hold one variable level as given, it is a bit like zooming in to only one row or one column.
  * General calculation: Cell value of a row or column sum.

The `prop.table()` function will be very helpful to us!

## Risk and odds

"Risk" refers to the probability of occurrence of an event or outcome. Statistically, risk = chance of the outcome of interest/all possible outcomes. The term “odds” is often used instead of risk. "Odds" refers to the probability of occurrence of an event/probability of the event not occurring. At first glance, though these two concepts seem similar and interchangeable, there are important differences that dictate where the use of either of these is appropriate.

~ From [Common pitfalls in statistical analysis: Odds versus risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640017/)

---
## Hospitalization risk and odds

Let's folks on folks 80 to 89.

```
           Hospitalized Not hospitalized
  80 to 89         3354           536361
```

This __risk__ of being hospitalized for this group is `\(\frac{3354}{3354+536361} = 0.0062\)`.

The __odds__ of being hospitalized are `\(\frac{3354}{536361} = 0.0063\)`. 

These values look fairly similar. Odds and risks __will__ be similar when the outcome of interest is rare. This can be seen by the fact that the only difference between the two calculations is whether the count of the outcome is included in the denominator or not. As a rule of thumb, an outcome is 'rare' if it occurs less than 10% of the time. 

---
## Odds ratio and risk ratios

Risk ratios are also called 'relative' risks. Risk ratios and odds ratios are...ratios of risks and odds respectively.

They are used to make comparisons between groups. Let's for example, compare 80 to 89 year olds with 10 to 19 year olds.

```
           Hospitalized Not hospitalized
  10 to 19           92          1617845
  80 to 89         3354           536361
```

`$$OR = \frac{3354/536361}{92/1617845} = 110$$`
`$$RR = \frac{3354/(3354+536361)}{92/(92+1617845)} = 109$$`
.footnote[Once again, these values are similar because being hospitalized is (thankfully!) rare.]

---
## When do we use RR vs OR?

Calculation of _risk_ requires as to know how many people are 'at risk'. As we'll see next week, in case-control studies, where such totals are not available to us, we cannot calculate a relative risk. BUT, we can calculate odds ratios and make a comment on the strength of association between our exposure and the outcome. 

In cohort studies, where we do have the number number exposed, we can calculate either/both.

Logistic regression, which we'll be seeing more of in the next few weeks, calculates adjusted ORs and not RRs and so being able to interpret them is going to be important to us.

## Generalized linear models (GLMs)

Generalized linear models are a **flexible** class of models that let us *generalize* from the linear model to include more types of response variables, such as *count, binary, and proportion data*.

.center[&lt;img src="libs/images/w7/flex.jpg" height=370&gt; ]

Let's get flexible, flexible...


---
## Assumptions of the Generalized Linear Model

- The data `\(Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n\)` are independently distributed, i.e., cases are independent.
  - Thus errors are independent... but NOT necessarily normally distributed.  
--
&lt;br&gt;
- The dependent variable `\(Y_i\)` does NOT need to be normally distributed, but it  assumes a distribution, typically from an exponential family (e.g. binomial, Poisson, gamma,...)
--
&lt;br&gt;
- GLM does NOT assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, but **it does assume a linear relationship between the transformed response (in terms of the link function) and the explanatory variables**; e.g., for binary logistic regression `\(logit(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X\)`.
--
&lt;br&gt;
- Explanatory variables can be even the power terms or some other non-linear transformations of the original independent variables.  
--
&lt;br&gt;
- The homogeneity of variance does NOT need to be satisfied. 
--
&lt;br&gt;
- It uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the parameters, and thus relies on large-sample approximations.

---
## Components of a Generalized Linear Model
Generalized linear models have three parts:

1.  **random** component: the response and an associated probability distribution   
2. **systematic** component: explanatory variables and relationships among them (e.g., interaction terms) 
3. **link function**, which tell us about the relationship between the systematic component (or linear predictor) and the mean of the response

It is the **link function** that allows us to generalize the linear models for count, binomial and percent data. It ensures the linearity and constrains the predictions to be within a range of possible values.

## Shuttle data

.pull-left[On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members. The spacecraft **disintegrated** over the Atlantic Ocean. The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right rocket booster failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the **failure of O-ring seals** used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch.

.pull-right[
.center[&lt;img src="libs/images/w7/Challenger_explosion.jpg" height=250&gt;]

We will look at a data set about the number of rubber O-rings showing thermal distress for 23 flights of the space shuttle, with the ambient temperature and pressure at which tests on the putty next to the rings were performed.

## Follow along with the case study

You can follow along with this case study using the template available in the `sta303-bolton/sta303w7` package.


```r
# Only need to download if your didn't for the cheat sheet
# or if your JupyterHub session is new
devtools::install_github("sta303-bolton/sta303w7")

# If it prompts you to update packages, 
# just click 'Enter' or 'Return' or input 3
```

Then, go to File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown and choose 'From template' and select 'Challenger case study {sta303w7}'. 

Important: If you're working in the JupyterHub, make sure you save the .Rmd in a subfolder of your Home directory so it doesn't cause class interactives to fail in future. (Can't have any .Rmd in your Home directory.)

- `m`: number of rings
- `r`: number of damaged rings

&lt;br&gt;

Thus we have a situation where we are interested in the number of successes out of a fixed number of trials. Hopefully your memories of the Binomial distribution are being triggered by that language.

## Are shuttle rings more likely to get damaged in cold weather? 

We can think of __m__ as the number of trials, and __r__ as the number of "successes". (It feels weird to call damage a success, but it is our outcome of interest, so we treat it as such.)

.pull-left[
`\begin{align*}
Y_i \sim &amp; \text{Binomial}(N_i, \mu_i)\\
\log\left(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}\right) = &amp; X_i \beta
\end{align*}`
]

.pull-right[
- m: number of rings, `\(N_i\)`
- r: number of damaged rings `\(Y_i\)`
- pressure, temperature: covariates `\(X_i\)`
- `\(\mu_i\)`: probability of a ring becoming damaged given `\(X_i\)` 
- `\(\beta_{\text{temperature}}\)`: parameter of interest

- The `\(Y_i\)` are *independently distributed*
- **Joint density** `\(\pi\)` of random variables `\((Y_1  ...Y_N)\)` is the product of the marginal
densities `\(f_G\)`.
- **Likelihood function** `\(L\)` given observed data `\(y_1 ... y_N\)` is a function of the parameters.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**:
$$
\hat\beta, \hat\theta = \text{argmax}_{\beta,\theta}L(\beta, \theta ; y_1 \ldots y_N)
$$
- The best parameters are those which are most likely to produce the observed

## Shuttle example in R

- `glm` works like `lm` with a `family` argument.
- Binomial models can take two types of inputs:
  - If, as in this case, we have groups of trials, we need our response to be a matrix with two columns: `y` and `N-y`.
  - If our `y` is a single 0/1 (or otherwise binary categorical variable) then we can set it up as usual, just a single column.


```r
shuttle$notDamaged &lt;- shuttle$m - shuttle$r
shuttle$y &lt;- as.matrix(shuttle[,c('r','notDamaged')])
shuttleFit &lt;- glm(y ~ temperature + pressure, 
  family=binomial(link='logit'), data=shuttle)
shuttleFit$coef

```
## [1] 0.065

- Each degree increase in temperature (in Fahrenheit) decreases the odds of damage by

## Week 7 learning checklist

By the end of week 7, you should be able to:

* Recognize a form of the probability density function for Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, Poisson, gamma and 
* Identify how changing values for a parameter affects the characteristics of the probability distribution.
* Identify the mean and variance for each distribution.
* Match the response for a study to a plausible random variable and provide reasons for ruling out other random variables.
* Match a histogram of sample data to plausible distributions.
* Create tables and calculate joint, marginal and conditional probabilities with them.
* Calculate odds, risks, odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR).
* Understand why ORs and RRs are similar for rare outcomes.
* State the assumptions of GLMs.
* Interpret logistic regression output (more next week.)

## Efficient maximization (for your reference only)

- Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares is the 'classic' algorithm  when `\(G\)` is in the exponential family
- ... but GLMs are easy for any density which is differentiable
- The derivatives with respect to `\(\beta\)`  are easy to compute with the chain rule
`\begin{multline*}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_p} \log L(\beta, \theta ; y_1 \ldots t_N) = \\
	 \sum_{i=1}^N \left[\frac{d}{d \mu} \log f_G (Y_i; \mu, \theta)
\right]_{\mu = h^{-1}(X_i^T\beta)} 
\left[ 
\frac{d}{d \eta}h^{-1}(\eta)
\right]_{\eta = X_i^T\beta} \cdot X_{ip}
\end{multline*}`
- Analytical expressions exist for the derivatives of `\(\log f_G\)` and `\(h^{-1}\)`
- Second derivatives are also tractable
- Numerical maximization to find `\(\hat\beta\)` is fast when derivatives are
  available

---
## Numerical maximizers (for your reference only)

- There are hundreds of them!
- `optim` is the standard `R` optimizer, which has 6 methods available.
    - some methods will use gradients if you provide them.
    
- `TrustOptim` uses derivatives and 'trust regions', the method used in INLA.
- `ipopt` is probably the cutting edge.
- Statisticians don't make enough use of of-the-shelf optimizers.

---
## Automatic differentiation (for your reference only)

`$$\sum_{i=1}^N \left[\frac{d}{d \mu} \log f_G (Y_i; \mu, \theta)
\right]_{\mu = h^{-1}(X_i^T\beta)} 
\left[ 
\frac{d}{d \eta}h^{-1}(\eta)
\right]_{\eta = X_i^T\beta} \cdot X_{ip}$$`

- Overkill for most GLMs, but infinitely extensible.
- Computers evaluate logs, sines, and other functions through some Taylor-series-like polynomial thing.
- ... which are easy to differentiate!
- AD programs can take computer code and figure out how to differentiate it.
- Used in Neural Nets, Hamiltonian MCMC, optimization, and many more.
